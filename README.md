# Fraud Detection in Bitcoin Transactions

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of our research on **fraud detection in Bitcoin transactions** using **graph-based models** and **deep learning**. Our approach models Bitcoin transactions as a graph and applies **Variational Graph Autoencoders (VGAE)** along with supervised learning for fraud detection.

## Features
- **Graph-based Transaction Analysis:** We construct a transaction graph to model Bitcoin interactions.
- **Network Analysis for Feature Extraction:** We extract informative graph-based features.
- **Deep Learning for Classification:** We use a **Deep Neural Network (DNN)** as the classifier.
- **Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE):** We generate graph embeddings for fraud detection.


## Dataset
The dataset used in this research consists of real Bitcoin transaction data. Please refer to the paper for details on data preprocessing and feature extraction.

## Results
Our experimental results indicate that the proposed **VGAE-based fraud detection** significantly improves fraud detection in high-risk areas of the Bitcoin transaction graph.
